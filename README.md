# Instacart-Analysis-Python
Analysis of an online grocery store customer orders to identify sales pattern using Python.

## Overview
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. It already has very good sales, but wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They want to come up with a targeted marketing strategy to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
##### *(Stakeholders: Vice President of Marketing, Senior Vice President of Sales, Instacart Customer)* 

## Objective
Analyze Instacart's data to uncover information about sales patterns. This is to be done by performing initial data and exploratory analysis of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

## Key Questions
The Instacart stakeholders are looking into data-driven answers for the following key questions in order to come up with a better segmentation strategy:
* **What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?**
  * The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* **Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?**
  * They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* **How can Instacart use simpler price range groupings for products?** 
  * Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* **Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?** 
  * The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* **The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.**  
For example:
  * **What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?**
  * **Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?**
  * **Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?**
  * **Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?**
  * **What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?**
    * Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  * **What differences exist in ordering habits of different customer profiles?**
    * Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
